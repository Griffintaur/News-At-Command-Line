# News at the Command line
### Want to be kept updated without visiting the news portals every now and then

 Now you don't need to visit each news portal website separately to read their articles. Just use the tool and read the articles without even clicking a single mouse button.


# Modules Requirements

- **Python 2.7 +**
- **Requests** 
- **Beautiful Soup** 
- **PyYAML**

To install the module dependencies before running the application, simply navigate into the project folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

#### I recommend installing Python Anaconda so that all useful libraries are available at one go.
# Working
- All sample input images are placed under the **Images** folder.
- You can change the maximum number of posts in **config.yml**. Look for **Limit** attribute.

# How To Use
 Just run the Main.py. 
 You can understand the rest while using it for the first time.
 ### To execute
    python News/Main.py
 ### To install
    python setup.py install
    newsctl
